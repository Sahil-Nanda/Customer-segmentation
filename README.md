# Customer-segmentation
This project uses RFM analysis and K-means clustering to segment the customers of a UK based retail store. The RFM analysis defines recency, frequency and monetary value for all the customers and k-means clustering groups the customers on these values. Such segmentation predicts the behavior of customers and help businesses to propose them better options & opportunities.
